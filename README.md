# Heart Disease Binary Classification - MATLAB Project

## 🧠 Project Description
This project applies **binary classification** techniques to predict whether a patient is at risk of cardiovascular diseases based on medical features.
The machine learning models are trained and evaluated using **gradient descent**, **stochastic gradient descent**, and **Newton's method** optimization algorithms implemented manually in MATLAB.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)
- **Features used:**
  - Age
  - Sex
  - Chest Pain Type
  - Resting Blood Pressure
  - Cholesterol
  - Fasting Blood Sugar
  - Resting ECG Results
  - Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
  - Exercise Induced Angina
  - ST Depression (Oldpeak)
  - ST Slope
- **Target variable:** Presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.

> *Note: Categorical variables (Sex, ChestPainType, RestingECG, ExerciseAngina, ST_Slope) were numerically encoded.*
